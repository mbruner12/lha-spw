Quintannles on Latinas and sexuality and cultural differences; not many Latinas doing organizing; non-latinas don't understand the culture and the issues; talking about sexuality and dating difficult; need to think about values and cultural backgrounds when organizing and not focus on oppression;
 Maureen Rafferty: from Wages Due Lesbians San Francisco: creating relationships based on organizing together; working with lesbians she can be a lesbian working on racism, on rape, etc and hasn't had to set her sexuality aside, doesn't have to think bout it as her ""private life"". thinks of  lesbianism as a struggle; compares it to mainstream orgs who se it as genetic and not something you choose and objects to that - sees sexuality as a continuum not something you re born with.  Right now battling Lesbian and Gay Freedom Day committee because they are  making it into a business i.e. charging people for booths; she wants to talk about what we do in bedrooms and keep our jobs so they have been organizing around work issues; At Danish conference there were people saying there were no lesbians in developing countries, especially people from the left but in order to choose to be a lesbian you have to be able to support yourself without a man, both in the US and elsewhere.  In SF they are also working with a prostitutes' collective; Finally, we can't join coalitions without putting out our ideas and issues as lesbians.
Discussion: A woman who identifies herself as a black lesbian: lack of role models; not so visible; never heard the term lesbian - heard bulldagger; doesn't get Wages Due lesbians --wages from whom?  For What? doesn't get the idea that women can leave their husbands to become lesbians if they have enough money
      Maureen Rafferty responded:  how all of this takes place within capitalism regardless of culture
      Other women: language of economics not good for psychological and sexual language

Note enclosed with tape is kept in donors binder, and reads as follows:

Meeting at the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, November 19, 1990 between representatives of ACT UP and CDC Officials about why they should change the Centers for Disease Control's definition of AIDS to include infections that women and injection drug users were getting.
Attending: Katrina Haslip (women with AIDS working with ACT UP NY, Lifeforce  - heterosexual - who had also worked with ACE at Bedford Hills Prison and who died in Fall 1992); Maggie Hasbrouk, lesbian from ACT UP Atlanta; Maxine Wolfe and Tracy Morgan (lesbians from ACT UP NY) and Chip Rowan (gay man from ACT UP Atlanta). From the CDC: Gary Noble, Ruth Berkelman, Mary Guinan, Jacob Gayle, Peter Drotman, Bert Petersen, Bill Para.
For 3 1/2 years, led by Lesbians from ACT UP NY and DC and in conjunction with a law suit filed, subsequently, by Terry McGovern, a lawyer working for the HIV Law Project in NY and later making it an autonomous project, AIDS activists and service providers around the country engaged in a campaign to change the CDC definition of AIDS to include the infections women and injection drug users got. It began with an action at the CDC in Jan. 1990 (in conjunction with an anti-sodomy law action) and ended finally, in Dec. 1992 when the CDC agreed to include cervical cancer, TB and bacterial infections in the definition and in May 1993 when SSA agreed to give disability to women and injection drug users for an even broader range of infections. This campaign included the action in Jan. 1990, actions meetings with people at NIH, actions at the Dec. 1990 Women and HIV conference (which we forced the government to hold an endorsement campaign from Dec. 1990 thru June of 1991 eventuating in an ad in the NY Times in June 1991 (Women Don't Get AIDS, They Just Die From It) along with actions against local CDC offices in May 1991, postcard zaps throughout the fall of 91 and petitions from numerous groups around the country more letters and fax zaps throughout the Spring of 1992, testimony at all types of government hearings and teach-ins all through these years, Terry McGovern filing the SSA lawsuit in Oct. 1990, confronting Curran at the 1992 Int. AIDS conference after we had a nationwide campaign to senators and reps to investigate the CDC after we saw their draft regs which still did not include women's infections and finally forcing them to hold a public hearing which occured in Atlanta in Fall 1992 to which we raised money for women with HIV from around the country to attend and forced them to place women with HIV and a range of researchers on the panels (rather than their orig. plan which was for them to have CDC officials tell us why we couldn't add these infections).
Finally, in Dec. 1992they agreed to add cervical cancer, TB, and bacterial infections as well as 200 T cells. In May 1993 they also changed the disability regs. Katrina Haslip, who died in Dec. 1992 was one of the HIV+ women who led this fight speaking openly about being infected and incredibly politically about the issues. Ironically, she died without a CDC definition because the change went into effect in Jan. 1993, one month after she died.
This transcript is of a meeting before our second large action. It was our chance to get them to say what was really going on and to tell them why it was unacceptable.

These are two tapes from a meeting which took place on July 27, 1990 at the National Institute of Health. (a transcript-typed should be both in the ACT UP NY File and in Maxine Wolfe's Special Collection). The lesbians present at that meeting were: From ACT UP NY: Maxine Wolfe, Heidi Dorow, Risa Denenberg, and Garance Franke-Rute. From ACT UP DC: Linda Meredith, Melinda Daniels, and Laurie Sprecher. (Melinda Daniels has a video tape of the meeting). Present from the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases were Tony Fauci (head of NIAID and of AIDS Research), Daniel Hoth (head of the Division of AIDS which oversees the AIDS Clinical Trial Groups) and some of their colleagues.
Men from ACT UP had been meeting with government officials for a long time but even when well-intentioned were unable to actually articulate the issues confronting Women with HIV/AIDS. In ACT UP NY in March 1989 we had held a teach-in on Women with HIV/AIDS, produced a handbook which then became a book (South End Press, Women, AIDS and Activism). We were also working on a campaign to change Centers for Disease Control's definition of AIDS to include infections of women and injection drug users (it was changed in 1992, Dec.) and to include women in clinical research trials and to get trials which researched women's diseases in relation to HIV. We decided we had to make our demands to the government in person and forcefully to move this agenda along. We had been working with women with HIV around the country and with ACT UP women's caucuses around the country. Linda Meridith was a founder of ACT UP Atlanta where we first me and then a founder of ACT UP DC when she moved to Washington. ACT UP DC women and NY women, along with others in the network worked together to press for this meeting beginning with a sit in at the NIH in Dan Hoth's office in May 1990 where we wrote our demands on his chalkboardand left flyers all over his office, continuing with a set of phone calls in which we demanded that he meet with us, a zap in front of 5000 of his colleagues when he delivered an address at the S.F. Intl. Conference on AIDS in June followed by a note that if he did not meet with us we would invade his office again. Apparently he was very afraid of us because in coming to the S.F. conference he had bodyguards (Linda Meredith had been sending him demanding letters since the sit-in). Finally, after the note to him at the conference which said speak to us or we'll be back, he agreed to a meeting. Fauci showed up as well. It was at this meeting that we made a list of 10 demands, most of which were eventually met. The first was a conference on Women with HIV - there had been none over all of the years of the epidemic - this took place in Dec. 1990. For a description of the early years of suppression of information about women and HIV/AIDS and about the women who fought to have this changed, see Gena Corea's book The Invisible Epidemic, Women and HIV (1992) and my chapter (Maxine Wolfe: ACT UP NY: a Direct Action Political Mode of AIDS Prevention and Services, in  my file)

Meetings between Women with HIV/AIDS and AIDS activists with Sten Vermund, head of epidemiology at NIAID and later that week with staff people at NIAID (arranged by Diane Hartell) to discuss the first natural history study of women with HIV, Dec. 4, 1991 and Dec. 6, 1991
As part of the ACT UP Women's Network's ongoing work concerning women with HIV we had made a demand at our July meeting with Tony Fauci that there had to be a major epidemiological study of women with HIV. The NIAID had conducted the MACS study following 5,000 gay/bi men with HIV from 1984 on, spent millions on it and it served as the basis for all of the info about T cells, infections, etc. But it did not contain any women. Sten Vermund, of NIAID, who organized that study, had been pleading for one for women for years but Fauci paid him no mind, partly because he was busy pacifying the ACT UP men who eventually became his supporters (Mark Harrington, Peter Staley, et al.) by putting all of NIAID's money into clinical trials for men. Sten Vermund was, and as of this writing still is, an ally of the ACT UP women (he had done research on HPV and HIV). In our CDC campaign he was the lone government voice supporting our position. We arranged this meeting with him to state our concerns about this first study (which we pressured Fauci to fund) in terms of who would be in it, how it would be done, etc.
Diane Hartell was a good friend of Jeff Gates, a PWA from ACT UP NY who was also a friend of mine. She got this job working as Sten's assistant (before she had worked with injection drug using women) and orchestrated all of these meetings to support us. The first meeting took place with Sten and about 25 people attending during the ACTG meetings also held that week. Then on Friday, Dec. 6, about 15 women we had organizedmet with other NIAID staff people involved in ongoing epi studies and who would be involved in the later ones. We shared with them our issues.
The epi study was finally funded and then Bush appointed Healy as head of NIH and she held up the fund to ""review"" the work. We did a national phone zap and got the funds released.
At that meeting with Sten we insisted that we have people on the peer review panels to avoid doing business as usual (giving grants to well-heeled researchers who saw no women) and that we also create a national overview board with women PWAs and activists to make sure the study went well. We also told him he had to help those sites seeing all of the women who were not researchers to create grant applications which could get the funding. Both happened and because Linda Meredith and Keri Duran (HIV+, Boston ACT UP) sat on the peer review panel, the final grants went to Judith Cohen's group in SF, Kathy Anastas' group in the Bronx and Mary Lucy's group (Alexandra Levine, MD) in LA. All of these studies included lesbian issues and all were based on cooperation with community based groups. A fourth one went to Mary Young at Georgetown who was an M.D. we located and enlisted in our CDC and SSA work because she had data relevant and saw many women. However, her grant was not great but they gave it to her anyway.

The ACT UP CDC Committee chose Linda Meredith to speak for the activists; Mary Lucey spoke for women with HIV; we gave them a list of doctors.
We also arranged for the press to be there when the hearing was over. So when James Curran (Head of the CDC) walked out after the hearing he confronted the press and that is when he said they would be changing the definition to include some women's infections and bacterial pneumonia (which poor people and drug users also got).  The definition was officially changed in Nov. 1992 and went into effect in January 1993.",,"Bethesda, MD",CDC & ACT UP NY,Linda Meredith,Why the CDC should change the definition of AIDS,
